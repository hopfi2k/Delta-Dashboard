# DELTA Dashboard

This script pulls data from a DELTA Inverter via RS-485 by the help of a cheap USB-RS-485 dongle and pushes the data to a dashboard via websockets and to a ModBusTCP server.

This script is currently **NOT** functional and is considered as WIP.


### Installation:

Make sure the host has `git` and `pip` areavailable. If not, please install via `sudo apt install git python3-pip`. 

Now clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/hopfi2k/Delta-Dashboard
cd Delta-Dashboard
```
Next install the necessary Python packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the dashboard:
```
python3 ./main.py
```
To show the Dashboard open a browser and enter the URL that was shown (usually something like `http://<IP>:8080`).
